  articleText: "After becoming a mom to a special needs child who was in and out of the hospital, it became difficult for us to be there for family and friends along with them being there for him. I realized the lack of options for being “there” when not all of us could psychically be there. I wanted to do something that went beyond flowers or the typical overpriced gift basket.\n\nMy standards were high; I wanted something presentable, personal, and with purposeful product that was simple to send. As I explored this need, I discovered that others wanted a modern and seamless gifting experience too.\n\nI had a vision to create this concept as it did not exist. I created gift boxes for non-profits along with fundraisers, then started an Etsy shop primarily as a hobby. 3 years later once my special needs son was off to preschool and healthier, I was able to bring my vision to life.\n\nMy e-commerce website lets customers either build a thematic, expertly curated option, or build the perfect gift box for any occasion through my build a box platform. Whether personal, bridal or corporate, we top each gift with a handwritten note and ship throughout the United States. While modern technology powers my business, it’s why the Country needs companies like mine.\n\nMy approach to business is centered around honoring and maintaining the most important relationships in a tangible way. I am committed to make elevated gifting accessible, affordable, and an everyday option for my loyal customers along with building a business my team is proud and happy to work for.",
